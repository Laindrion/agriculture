                                        Agri-food systems, covering food production to disposal, are becoming
                                        increasingly globalized, concentrated, industrialized, and science and
                                        capital-intensive. Consumer preferences are changing because of various factors,
                                        especially rapid urbanization and increases in income levels. GHG emissions from
                                        the agri-food sector, including methane, have increased sharply.
                                        While food production surged in 50 years, malnutrition shifted from inadequate
                                        intake to unhealthy diets causing obesity and chronic diseases in areas like
                                        Central Asia. Agri-food systems also face food safety issues, transboundary
                                        diseases, and food waste.
                                        Current systems are socially, economically, and environmentally unsustainable,
                                        necessitating policy changes. awareness of the concept of agri-food systems, the
                                        advantages of adopting an agri-food systems approach and the challenges of
                                        transitioning to more sustainable systems are still not fully understood by all
                                        stakeholders. The UN Food Systems Summit held in 2021 and the recent Food
                                        Systems Stock-taking Moment held in July 2023 represent important attempts to
                                        raise awareness of these issues
                                        Accordingly, Technical Session 1 will clarify the concept of agri-food systems,
                                        the advantages of adopting this approach, the complexities of shifting toward
                                        sustainability. This is crucial for landlocked countries facing challenges in
                                        global value chain access because they do not have direct access to the sea,
                                        which the host country, doubly landlocked, exemplifies.
                                        Lasting for one hour and 15 minutes, Technical Session 1 will start with a 6-8
                                        minute stage setting introduction, followed by a panel with five speakers, each
                                        delivering a 5-6 minute talk (or presentation), who will provide insights on
                                        selected issues. The moderator of the panel discussion will facilitate a Q&A
                                        session with the speakers and the audience and summarize the conclusions of the
                                        session. on an aspect of agri-food system sustainability.
                                        The speakers will a) provide an overview of the food systems approach and what
                                        it means for a food system to be sustainable, with special attention to the
                                        problems faced by landlocked countries, b) describe the political aspects of
                                        moving towards sustainability, c) analyze the practical aspects of managing the
                                        transition to a more environmentally sustainable one, d) discuss the key
                                        conclusions of the UN Food Systems Summit and the Stock-taking Moment and e)
                                        describe the key elements of the food system of Uzbekistan.

                                        Despite the adoption of Sustainable Development Goal 2 to end hunger, the
                                        prevalence of hunger has grown. Projections for 2030 indicate that around 670
                                        million people, 8 percent of the global population, will remain hungry,
                                        equivalent to the 2015 SDG launch figure. Moreover, one-third of the global
                                        population suffers from other forms of malnutrition including obesity. Global
                                        Nutrition Targets 2025 are also unmet, emphasizing the challenge of providing
                                        affordable, nutritious diets to vulnerable populations due to inequities in
                                        societies and food systems.
                                        Technical Session 2 aims to enhance conference attendees' understanding of
                                        current food security and nutrition conditions, exploring potential solutions
                                        rooted in food systems to enhance access to healthy diets. It draws on
                                        discussions at the UN Food Systems Summit and the subsequent UN Food System
                                        Stock-taking Moment. The 'holistic' food systems approach will be emphasized to
                                        bolster nutritional outcomes, highlighting the significance of multi-sectoral
                                        collaboration and cooperation in addressing food security and nutrition issues.
                                        The session is organized around selected food systems-based solutions pertinent
                                        to the Eurasian context, encouraging feedback from participants. These solutions
                                        encompass the development of national food-system based dietary guidelines for
                                        agriculture and nutrition policies, advocating for healthy diets rooted in local
                                        ecosystems, integrating nutrition-sensitive social protection to enable
                                        vulnerable households' access to healthier diets while fostering local food
                                        systems, and enhancing the impact of school feeding programs to benefit children
                                        and promote co-benefits across food systems.
                                        The session will last for 1 hour and 15 minutes. It will commence with a
                                        stage-setting presentation of 6-8 minutes on the current food security and
                                        nutrition landscape and potential food system-based solutions for access to
                                        healthy diets. This will be followed by a panel with three speakers, each
                                        delivering a 5-6 minute talk (or presentation), who will provide insights on
                                        selected solutions, including food system-based dietary guidelines,
                                        nutrition-sensitive social protection and school food programmes. The moderator
                                        of the panel discussion will facilitate a Q&A session with the audience and
                                        summarize the conclusions of the session. Overall, the session at the conference
                                        underscores the urgency of addressing food security and nutrition challenges
                                        through comprehensive food system solutions.

                                        Climate change has emerged as a significant threat to food security across the
                                        globe, with landlocked regions such as Central Asia particularly vulnerable. In
                                        Central Asia, the impacts of climate change are intensified due to its arid and
                                        semi-arid climate, which significantly affects water availability and
                                        agricultural productivity.
                                        The objective of the technical session "Climate Change Impacts on Food Security"
                                        is to facilitate a comprehensive and in-depth discussion on the challenges and
                                        implications of climate change for food security in the region. The session aims
                                        to bring together experts, policymakers, and stakeholders to explore strategies
                                        and solutions for enhancing the resilience of food systems in the face of
                                        climate change. By fostering dialogue on innovative approaches, policy
                                        frameworks, and collaborative initiatives, the session seeks to increase
                                        awareness about the specific climate change impacts that affect food security,
                                        share knowledge and research findings and foster collaboration and partnerships.
                                        It provides a platform for participants to understand the linkages between
                                        climate change, agricultural practices, and food production systems.

                                        Women play a vital role in food security. Across the globe, rural women are
                                        involved in agrifood systems predominantly as agricultural labourers, seasonal,
                                        part-time, low qualified, low paid, or not paid at all, or as contributing
                                        family members in smallholdings and subsistence farms. Their access to economic
                                        opportunities and working conditions are influenced by gender inequalities
                                        within the household, the community, the institutions, and the broader society.
                                        The costs of gender inequality are tremendous, not only for women but also for
                                        agriculture, the broader economy and society. Closing existing gender gaps in
                                        accessing agricultural assets, inputs and services will help to promote gender
                                        equality and women’s empowerment, which are central to the transition towards
                                        sustainable and resilient agrifood systems.
                                        The session’s objectives are to acknowledge rural women’s role and contribution
                                        to agrifood systems, raise awareness on the links between rural women’s
                                        empowerment, sustainable rural livelihoods and improved food security, and
                                        provide inputs to informed policy and decision-making, highlighting best
                                        practices in policies and practices. The session will achieve it by sharing
                                        knowledge and research findings and suggesting approaches and measures that
                                        successfully address gender equality concerns in the context of agrifood
                                        systems.
                                        The session will attempt to answer the following question: How is rural women’s
                                        empowerment linked to food security and transformative agrifood systems, and
                                        what needs to be done to ensure that agrifood security policies, programmes and
                                        scientific advancements are inclusive for their effectiveness and
                                        sustainability?
                                        Technical Session 5, which will last for 1 hour and 15 minutes, will start with

                                        systems. The report provides policymakers and development actors with an
                                        extensive review of what has worked. This will be followed by evidence supported
                                        by cases from Tajikistan, Türkiye and Uzbekistan and other countries that link
                                        evidence, policy formulation and practice.
                                        The moderator of the panel discussion will facilitate a Q&A session with the
                                        speakers and the audience and summarize the conclusions of the technical

                                        Water and food security are fundamental for a thriving global population.
                                        However, Central Asia and many regions around the world struggle with water
                                        scarcity and challenges in food safety. Poor management and pollution from
                                        farming chemicals not only diminish the quality of our water and food but also
                                        pose significant health threats. This session underscores the intricate link
                                        between clean farming, water, food security, and the overall health of our
                                        communities.
                                        The main objective of this Technical Session is to highlight the importance of
                                        good water management and clean farming for creating a healthier society and
                                        environment. Attendees will understand how clean agriculture directly impacts
                                        food security, water conservation, public health and even household income. The
                                        Session aims to demonstrate that everyone, from individuals to businesses, plays
                                        a role in achieving these goals. Through shared knowledge and dialogue, this
                                        session strives to kindle a transition towards more sustainable agricultural
                                        practices, ensuring cleaner water, improved food security and family income, and
                                        healthier communities globally.
                                        Technical Session 6 also lasts for 1 hour and 15 minutes and starts with a 6-8
                                        minute stage-setting presentation on water and food security, clean agriculture,
                                        and public health, with a particular emphasis on its importance to the Central
                                        Asia region. This will be followed by a panel with five speakers who will
                                        provide insights into a) the confluence of water and food safety, clean farming,
                                        and public health, particularly in regions like Central Asia; b) the
                                        consequences of farming chemical misuse, highlighting the dire effects these
                                        chemicals have on water, food safety, and human health, particularly the
                                        heightened risks farmers face; c) the cumulative impacts of farming chemicals
                                        and how advanced technologies can identify and reduce the environmental and
                                        health risks of these chemicals; d) how sustainable agriculture works in
                                        practice, emphasizing the interplay between clean farming practices/regenerative
                                        agriculture, water conservation, and biodiversity; and e) the significance of
                                        incentives for farmers to convert to clean agricultural practices. Each speaker
                                        should speak for about 5-6 minutes. The moderator of the Technical Session will
                                        facilitate a Q&A session with the speakers and audience and summarize the
                                        conclusions of the technical session.

                                        Agri-food trade can make a crucial contribution to the welfare of rural
                                        households by opening up possibilities for earning income and thereby increasing
                                        consumption including food consumption. But the extent to which these households
                                        can benefit from trade depends on the comparative advantage of the country and
                                        on trade costs.
                                        In the case of Uzbekistan, the issue is complicated by the fact that it is a
                                        double landlocked country. Because it is generally far more expensive to
                                        transport bulky, low value goods overland than by sea, products like foodgrains
                                        can become effectively non-tradeable because of high costs. However, this need
                                        not apply to high-value agricultural commodities. The Government of Uzbekistan
                                        has expressed a desire to join the WTO in the hope of increasing trade in inter
                                        alia agri-food products.
                                        At the same time there are growing uncertainties about the prospects for
                                        agri-food trade and the global economy in the next few years, including slowing
                                        economic growth, continued inflation, especially for staple foods, high oil
                                        prices and slower growth in trade, including trade in agri-food products. The
                                        turmoil in foodgrain and oilseeds markets particularly is expected to continue.
                                        The principal objective of this technical session is to analyze the challenges
                                        of agri-food trade promotion for landlocked countries in the context of growing
                                        uncertainties. It will also explain explore some key considerations regarding
                                        WTO accession, which the government of Uzbekistan, along with other countries in
                                        Central Asia and elsewhere is interested in pursuing.
                                        As with the other Technical Sessions, Technical Session No. 7 will last for 1
                                        hour and 15 minutes and will begin with a 6-8 minute stage-setting presentation
                                        on the main challenges in agri-food trade promotion and food security. This will
                                        be followed by a panel with 3 speakers, each delivering a 5-6 minute talk (or
                                        presentation), who will provide insights into a) the key challenges for
                                        agri-food trade in the context of growing uncertainties; b) trade facilitation
                                        measures to overcome the handicap of being landlocked, including transport
                                        corridors and other measures; and c) some key considerations in conducting
                                        negotiations on WTO accession. The moderator of the panel discussion will
